We are Hunters Lodge ("**we**", "**us**" or "**our**"), a PlayStation trophy hunting community owned and operated by the Twitch streamer [EstoForShot](https://www.twitch.tv/estoforshort). We operate the web application at [hunterslodge.app](https://hunterslodge.app) (the "**App**"), as well as any other related products and services that refer or link to these terms of service (the "**Terms**") (collectively, the "**Services**").

You can contact us by email at <esto@hunterslodge.app>.

These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity ("**you**"), and us, concerning your access to and use of our Services. You agree that by accessing our Services, you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all of these Terms.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE TERMS, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING OUR SERVICES AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.

Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on our Services from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to these Terms from time to time. We will alert you about any changes by updating the "Last updated" date of these Terms, and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change. It is your responsibility to periodically review these Terms to stay informed of updates. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised Terms by your continued use of our Services after the date such revised Terms are posted.

Our Services are intended for users who are at least 13 years of age. All users who are minors in the jurisdiction in which they reside (generally under the age of 18) must have the permission of, and be directly supervised by, their parent or guardian to use our Services. If you are a minor, you must have your parent or guardian read and agree to these Terms prior to you using our Services.

We recommend that you print a copy of these Terms for your records.

## 1. Our Services

The information provided when using our Services is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access our Services from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.

Our Services are not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so if your interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use our Services. You may not use our Services in a way that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).

## 2. Intellectual Property Rights

### Our Intellectual Property

We are the owner or the licensee of all intellectual property rights in our Services, including all source code, databases, functionality, software, designs, audio, video, text, photographs, and graphics in our Services (collectively, the "**Content**").

Our Content is protected by copyright laws (and various other intellectual property rights and unfair competition laws) and treaties in the United States and around the world.

The Content is provided in or through our Services "**AS IS**" for your personal, non-commercial use only.

### Your Use of Our Services

- access our Services; and
- download or print a copy of any portion of the Content to which you have properly gained access

solely for your personal, non-commercial use.

Except as set out in this section or elsewhere in our Terms, no part of our Services and no Content may be copied, reproduced, aggregated, republished, uploaded, posted, publicly displayed, encoded, translated, transmitted, distributed, sold, licensed, or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose whatsoever, without our express prior written permission.

If you wish to make any use of our Services or Content other than as set out in this section or elsewhere in our Terms, please address your request to <esto@hunterslodge.app>. If we ever grant you the permission to post, reproduce, or publicly display any part of our Services or Content, you must identify us as the owners or licensors of our Services or Content and ensure that any copyright or proprietary notice appears or is visible on posting, reproducing, or displaying our Content.

We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you in and to our Services and Content.

## 9. Third-Party Accounts

As part of the functionality of our Services, you may link your account with online accounts you have with third-party service providers (each such account, a "**Third-Party Account**") by either:

- providing your Third-Party Account login information through our Services; or
- allowing us to access your Third-Party Account, as is permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of each Third-Party Account.

You represent and warrant that you are entitled to disclose your Third-Party Account login information to us and/or grant us access to your Third-Party Account, without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third-Party Account, and without obligating us to pay any fees or making us subject to any usage limitations imposed by the third-party service provider of the Third-Party Account. By granting us access to any Third-Party Accounts, you understand that (1) we may access, make available, and store (if applicable) any content that you have provided to and stored in your Third-Party Account (the "**Third-Party Content**") so that it is available on and through our Services via your account and (2) we may receive from your Third-Party Account additional information to the extent you are notified when you link your account with the Third-Party Account. Depending on the Third-Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such Third-Party Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your Third-Party Accounts may be available on and through your account on our Services. Please note that if a Third-Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or our access to such Third-Party Account is terminated by the third-party service provider, then Third-Party Content may no longer be available on and through our Services.

PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. We make no effort to review any Third-Party Content for any purpose, including but not limited to, for accuracy, legality, or non-infringement, and we are not responsible for any Third-Party Content.

## 10. Third-Party Websites and Content

Our Services may contain (or you may be sent via the App) links to other websites ("**Third-Party Websites**") as well as articles, photographs, text, graphics, pictures, designs, music, sound, video, information, applications, software, and other content or items belonging to or originating from third parties ("**Third-Party Content**"). Such Third-Party Websites and Third-Party Content are not investigated, monitored, or checked for accuracy, appropriateness, or completeness by us, and we are not responsible for any Third-Party Websites accessed through our Services or any Third-Party Content posted on, available through, or installed from our Services, including the content, accuracy, offensiveness, opinions, reliability, privacy practices, or other policies of or contained in the Third-Party Websites or the Third-Party Content. Inclusion of, linking to, or permitting the use or installation of any Third-Party Websites or any Third-Party Content does not imply approval or endorsement thereof by us. If you decide to leave our Services and access the Third-Party Websites or to use or install any Third-Party Content, you do so at your own risk, and you should be aware these Terms no longer govern. You should review the applicable terms and policies, including privacy and data gathering practices, of any website to which you navigate from our Services or relating to any applications you use or install from our Services. Any purchases you make through Third-Party Websites will be through other websites and from other companies, and we take no responsibility whatsoever in relation to such purchases which are exclusively between you and the applicable third party. You agree and acknowledge that we do not endorse the products or services offered on Third-Party Websites and you shall hold us blameless from any harm caused by your purchase of such products or services. Additionally, you shall hold us blameless from any losses sustained by you or harm caused to you relating to or resulting in any way from any Third-Party Content or any contact with Third-Party Websites.

- otherwise manage our Services in a manner designed to protect our rights and property and to facilitate the proper functioning of our Services.

## 12. Privacy Policy

We care about data privacy and security. Please review our [Privacy Policy](/docs/getting-started/privacy). By using our Services, you agree to be bound by our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms. Please be advised our Services are hosted in Estonia. If you access our Services from any other region of the world with laws or other requirements governing personal data collection, use, or disclosure that differ from applicable laws in Estonia, then through your continued use of our Services, you are transferring your data to Estonia, and you expressly consent to have your data transferred to and processed in Estonia. Further, we do not knowingly accept, request, or solicit information from children or knowingly market to children. Therefore, in accordance with the U.S. Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act, if we receive actual knowledge that anyone under the age of 13 has provided personal information to us without the requisite and verifiable parental consent, we will delete that information from the Services as quickly as is reasonably practical.

## 13. Term and Termination

These Terms shall remain in full force and effect while you use our Services. WITHOUT LIMITING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THESE TERMS, WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION AND WITHOUT NOTICE OR LIABILITY, DENY ACCESS TO AND USE OF OUR SERVICES (INCLUDING BLOCKING CERTAIN IP ADDRESSES), TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY REASON OR FOR NO REASON, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FOR BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR COVENANT CONTAINED IN THESE TERMS OR OF ANY APPLICABLE LAW OR REGULATION. WE MAY TERMINATE YOUR USE OR PARTICIPATION IN OUR SERVICES OR DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT AND ANY CONTENT OR INFORMATION THAT YOU POSTED AT ANY TIME, WITHOUT WARNING, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION.

If we terminate or suspend your account for any reason, you are prohibited from registering and creating a new account under your name, a fake or borrowed name, or the name of any third party, even if you may be acting on behalf of the third party. In addition to terminating or suspending your account, we reserve the right to take appropriate legal action, including without limitation pursuing civil, criminal, and injunctive redress.

## 14. Modifications and Interruptions

We reserve the right to change, modify, or remove the contents of our Services at any time or for any reason at our sole discretion without notice. However, we have no obligation to update any information on our Services. We will not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of our Services.

We cannot guarantee our Services will be available at all times. We may experience hardware, software, or other problems or need to perform maintenance related to our Services, resulting in interruptions, delays, or errors. We reserve the right to change, revise, update, suspend, discontinue, or otherwise modify our Services at any time or for any reason without notice to you. You agree that we have no liability whatsoever for any loss, damage, or inconvenience caused by your inability to access or use our Services during any downtime or discontinuance of our Services. Nothing in these Terms will be construed to obligate us to maintain and support our Services or to supply any corrections, updates, or releases in connection therewith.

## 15. Governing Law

These Legal Terms are governed by and interpreted following the laws of Estonia, and the use of the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sales of Goods is expressly excluded. If your habitual residence is in the EU, and you are a consumer, you additionally possess the protection provided to you by obligatory provisions of the law in your country to residence. Hunters Lodge and yourself both agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Estonia, which means that you may make a claim to defend your consumer protection rights in regards to these Terms in Estonia, or in the EU country in which you reside.

## 16. Dispute Resolution

The European Commission provides an [online dispute resolution platform](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr), which you can access. If you would like to bring this subject to our attention, please contact us.

## 24. Miscellaneous

These Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by us on our Services or in respect to our Services constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and us.

We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control.
